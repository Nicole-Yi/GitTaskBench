Try to install the Faker library again after confirming nothing else is blocking the installation process.\\n2. Verify if another dependency installation is blocking it.\\n3. Explore mocking libraries present in the Faker codebase, which might allow generating fake text without the need for an externally installed library.\\n\\nNext steps:\\n- Perform another attempt at installing the Faker library with a check for any environment hitches.\\n- Look for existing fake text generation utilities within the Faker codebase as alternatives or potential solutions.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "call_RqyF7EVw8kLT1rnN926yNdKb", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 14855, "total_tokens": 15026, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
