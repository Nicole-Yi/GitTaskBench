NoGAN training combines the benefits of GAN\n   144\ttraining (wonderful colorization) while eliminating the nasty side effects\n   145\t(like flickering objects in video). Believe it or not, video is rendered using\n   146\tisolated image generation without any sort of temporal modeling tacked on. The\n   147\tprocess performs 30-60 minutes of the GAN portion of \"NoGAN\" training, using 1%\n   148\tto 3% of imagenet data once.  Then, as with still image colorization, we\n   149\t\"DeOldify\" individual frames before rebuilding the video.\n   150\t\n   151\tIn addition to improved video stability, there is an interesting thing going on\n   152\there worth mentioning. It turns out the models I run, even different ones and\n   153\twith different training structures, keep arriving at more or less the same\n   154\tsolution.  That's even the case for the colorization of things you may think\n   155\twould be arbitrary and unknowable, like the color of clothing, cars, and even\n   156\tspecial effects (as seen in \"Metropolis\").\n   157\t\n   158\t![Metropolis Special FX](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HeavyLoneBlowfish-size_restricted.gif)\n   159\t\n   160\tMy best guess is that the models are learning some interesting rules about how to\n   161\tcolorize based on subtle cues present in the black and white images that I\n   162\tcertainly wouldn't expect to exist.  This result leads to nicely deterministic and\n   163\tconsistent results, and that means you don't have track model colorization\n   164\tdecisions because they're not arbitrary.  Additionally, they seem remarkably\n   165\trobust so that even in moving scenes the renders are very consistent.\n   166\t\n   167\t![Moving Scene Example](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/FamiliarJubilantAsp-size_restricted.gif)\n   168\t\n   169\tOther ways to stabilize video add up as well. First, generally speaking rendering\n   170\tat a higher resolution (higher render_factor) will increase stability of\n   171\tcolorization decisions.  This stands to reason because the model has higher\n   172\tfidelity image information to work with and will have a greater chance of making\n   173\tthe \"right\" decision consistently.  Closely related to this is the use of\n   174\tresnet101 instead of resnet34 as the backbone of the generator- objects are\n   175\tdetected more consistently and correctly with this. This is especially important\n   176\tfor getting good, consistent skin rendering.  It can be particularly visually\n   177\tjarring if you wind up with \"zombie hands\", for example.\n   178\t\n   179\t![Zombie Hand Example](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ThriftyInferiorIsabellinewheatear-size_restricted.gif)\n   180\t\n   181\tAdditionally, gaussian noise augmentation during training appears to help but at\n   182\tthis point the conclusions as to just how much are bit more tenuous (I just\n   183\thaven't formally measured this yet).  This is loosely based on work done in style\n   184\ttransfer video, described here:\n   185\t <https://medium.com/element-ai-research-lab/stabilizing-neural-style-transfer-for-video-62675e203e42>.\n   186\t\n   187\tSpecial thanks go to Rani Horev for his contributions in implementing this noise\n   188\taugmentation.\n   189\t\n   190\t### What is NoGAN?\n   191\t\n   192\tThis is a new type of GAN training that I've developed to solve some key problems\n   193\tin the previous DeOldify model. It provides the benefits of GAN training while\n   194\tspending minimal time doing direct GAN training.  Instead, most of the training\n   195\ttime is spent pretraining the generator and critic separately with more\n   196\tstraight-forward, fast and reliable conventional methods.  A key insight here is\n   197\tthat those more \"conventional\" methods generally get you most of the results you\n   198\tneed, and that GANs can be used to close the gap on realism. During the very\n   199\tshort amount of actual GAN training the generator not only gets the full\n   200\trealistic colorization capabilities that used to take days of progressively\n   201\tresized GAN training, but it also doesn't accrue nearly as much of the artifacts\n   202\tand other ugly baggage of GANs. In fact, you can pretty much eliminate glitches\n   203\tand artifacts almost entirely depending on your approach. As far as I know this\n   204\tis a new technique. And it's incredibly effective.\n   205\t\n   206\t#### Original DeOldify Model\n   207\t\n   208\t![Before Flicker](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/CoordinatedVeneratedHogget-size_restricted.gif)\n   209\t\n   210\t#### NoGAN-Based DeOldify Model\n   211\t\n   212\t![After Flicker](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/OilyBlackArctichare-size_restricted.gif)\n   213\t\n   214\tThe steps are as follows: First train the generator in a conventional way by\n   215\titself with just the feature loss. Next, generate images from that, and train\n   216\tthe critic on distinguishing between those outputs and real images as a basic\n   217\tbinary classifier. Finally, train the generator and critic together in a GAN\n   218\tsetting (starting right at the target size of 192px in this case).  Now for\n   219\tthe weird part:  All the useful GAN training here only takes place within a very\n   220\tsmall window of time.  There's an inflection point where it appears the critic\n   221\thas transferred everything it can that is useful to the generator. Past this\n   222\tpoint, image quality oscillates between the best that you can get at the\n   223\tinflection point, or bad in a predictable way (orangish skin, overly red lips,\n   224\tetc).  There appears to be no productive training after the inflection point.\n   225\tAnd this point lies within training on just 1% to 3% of the Imagenet Data!\n   226\tThat amounts to about 30-60 minutes of training at 192px.\n   227\t\n   228\tThe hard part is finding this inflection point.  So far, I've accomplished this\n   229\tby making a whole bunch of model save checkpoints (every 0.1% of data iterated\n   230\ton) and then just looking for the point where images look great before they go\n   231\ttotally bonkers with orange skin (always the first thing to go). Additionally,\n   232\tgenerator rendering starts immediately getting glitchy and inconsistent at this\n   233\tpoint, which is no good particularly for video. What I'd really like to figure\n   234\tout is what the tell-tale sign of the inflection point is that can be easily\n   235\tautomated as an early stopping point.  Unfortunately, nothing definitive is\n   236\tjumping out at me yet.  For one, it's happening in the middle of training loss\n   237\tdecreasing- not when it flattens out, which would seem more reasonable on the surface.\n   238\t\n   239\tAnother key thing about NoGAN training is you can repeat pretraining the critic\n   240\ton generated images after the initial GAN training, then repeat the GAN training\n   241\titself in the same fashion.  This is how I was able to get extra colorful results\n   242\twith the \"artistic\" model.  But this does come at a cost currently- the output of\n   243\tthe generator becomes increasingly inconsistent and you have to experiment with\n   244\trender resolution (render_factor) to get the best result.  But the renders are\n   245\tstill glitch free and way more consistent than I was ever able to achieve with\n   246\tthe original DeOldify model. You can do about five of these repeat cycles, give\n   247\tor take, before you get diminishing returns, as far as I can tell.\n   248\t\n   249\tKeep in mind- I haven't been entirely rigorous in figuring out what all is going\n   250\ton in NoGAN- I'll save that for a paper. That means there's a good chance I'm\n   251\twrong about something.  But I think it's definitely worth putting out there now\n   252\tbecause I'm finding it very useful- it's solving basically much of my remaining\n   253\tproblems I had in DeOldify.\n   254\t\n   255\tThis builds upon a technique developed in collaboration with Jeremy Howard and\n   256\tSylvain Gugger for Fast.AI's Lesson 7 in version 3 of Practical Deep Learning\n   257\tfor Coders Part I. The particular lesson notebook can be found here:\n   258\t  <https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/lesson7-superres-gan.ipynb>\n   259\t\n   260\t## Why Three Models?\n   261\t\n   262\tThere are now three models to choose from in DeOldify. Each of these has key\n   263\tstrengths and weaknesses, and so have different use cases.  Video is for video\n   264\tof course.  But stable and artistic are both for images, and sometimes one will\n   265\tdo images better than the other.\n   266\t\n   267\tMore details:\n   268\t\n   269\t- **Artistic** - This model achieves the highest quality results in image\n   270\tcoloration, in terms of interesting details and vibrance. The most notable\n   271\tdrawback however is that it's a bit of a pain to fiddle around with to get the\n   272\tbest results (you have to adjust the rendering resolution or render_factor to\n   273\tachieve this).  Additionally, the model does not do as well as stable in a few\n   274\tkey common scenarios- nature scenes and portraits.  The model uses a resnet34\n   275\tbackbone on a UNet with an emphasis on depth of layers on the decoder side.\n   276\tThis model was trained with 5 critic pretrain/GAN cycle repeats via NoGAN, in\n   277\taddition to the initial generator/critic pretrain/GAN NoGAN training, at 192px.\n   278\tThis adds up to a total of 32% of Imagenet data trained once (12.5 hours of\n   279\tdirect GAN training).\n   280\t\n   281\t- **Stable** - This model achieves the best results with landscapes and\n   282\tportraits.  Notably, it produces less \"zombies\"- where faces or limbs stay gray\n   283\trather than being colored in properly.  It generally has less weird\n   284\tmiscolorations than artistic, but it's also less colorful in general.  This\n   285\tmodel uses a resnet101 backbone on a UNet with an emphasis on width of layers on\n   286\tthe decoder side.  This model was trained with 3 critic pretrain/GAN cycle\n   287\trepeats via NoGAN, in addition to the initial generator/critic pretrain/GAN\n   288\tNoGAN training, at 192px.  This adds up to a total of 7% of Imagenet data\n   289\ttrained once (3 hours of direct GAN training).\n   290\t\n   291\t- **Video** - This model is optimized for smooth, consistent and flicker-free\n   292\tvideo.  This would definitely be the least colorful of the three models, but\n   293\tit's honestly not too far off from \"stable\". The model is the same as \"stable\"\n   294\tin terms of architecture, but differs in training.  It's trained for a mere 2.2% \n   295\tof Imagenet data once at 192px, using only the initial generator/critic \n   296\tpretrain/GAN NoGAN training (1 hour of direct GAN training).\n   297\t\n   298\tBecause the training of the artistic and stable models was done before the\n   299\t\"inflection point\" of NoGAN training described in \"What is NoGAN???\" was\n   300\tdiscovered, I believe this amount of training on them can be knocked down\n   301\tconsiderably. As far as I can tell, the models were stopped at \"good points\"\n   302\tthat were well beyond where productive training was taking place.  I'll be\n   303\tlooking into this in the future.\n   304\t\n   305\tIdeally, eventually these three models will be consolidated into one that has all\n   306\tthese good desirable unified.
