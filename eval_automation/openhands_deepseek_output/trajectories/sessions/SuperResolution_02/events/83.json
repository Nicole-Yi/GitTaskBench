The system is in a locked state where new commands cannot be executed\n2. Previous installation attempts for dependencies have failed\n3. Process cleanup attempts have been unsuccessful\n\nRecommended Actions:\n1. Manual intervention may be required to:\n   - Terminate all Python/pip processes at system level\n   - Clear pip's cache and lock files\n   - Verify network connectivity for package downloads\n\n2. If manual intervention isn't possible, we could:\n   - Use the existing partial installation\n   - Modify the script to work without OpenCV\n   - Implement basic image processing using PIL instead\n\nWould you like me to proceed with modifying the script to use PIL instead of OpenCV?
