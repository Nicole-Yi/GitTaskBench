But we also believe that there needs\n501-to be boundaries on just how much is reasonable to be expected from an open\n502-source project maintained by just two developers.\n503-\n504-Our stance is that we're providing the code and documentation on research that\n505-we believe is beneficial to the world.\u00a0 What we have provided are novel takes\n506-on colorization, GANs, and video that are hopefully somewhat friendly for\n507-developers and researchers to learn from and adopt. This is the culmination of\n508-well over a year of continuous work, free for you. What wasn't free was\n509-shouldered by us, the developers.\u00a0 We left our jobs, bought expensive GPUs, and\n510-had huge electric bills as a result of dedicating ourselves to this.\n511-\n512-What we haven't provided here is a ready to use free \"product\" or \"app\", and we\n513-don't ever intend on providing that.\u00a0 It's going to remain a Linux based project\n514-without Windows support, coded in Python, and requiring people to have some extra", "extras": {"command": "grep -n \"Pretrained Weights\" -A 20 /data/data/agent_test_codebase/GitTaskBench/code_base/DeOldify/README.md", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "openhands", "hostname": "ed83f7113658", "working_dir": "/data/data/agent_test_codebase/GitTaskBench", "py_interpreter_path": "/openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
