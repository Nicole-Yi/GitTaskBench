So if the error above this refers to some file\n          path to a cmake file inside a python or anaconda or miniconda path then you\n          should delete that broken copy of cmake from your computer.\n\n          Instead, please get an official copy of cmake from one of these known good\n          sources of an official cmake:\n              - cmake.org (this is how windows users should get cmake)\n              - apt install cmake (for Ubuntu or Debian based systems)\n              - yum install cmake (for Redhat or CenOS based systems)\n\n          On a linux machine you can run `which cmake` to see what cmake you are\n          actually using.  If it tells you it's some cmake from any kind of python\n          packager delete it and install an official cmake.\n\n          More generally, cmake is not installed if when you open a terminal window\n          and type\n             cmake --version\n          you get an error.  So you can use that as a very basic test to see if you\n          have cmake installed.  That is, if cmake --version doesn't run from the\n          same terminal window from which you are reading this error message, then\n          you have not installed cmake.  Windows users should take note that they\n          need to tell the cmake installer to add cmake to their PATH.  Since you\n          can't run commands that are not in your PATH.  This is how the PATH works\n          on Linux as well, but failing to add cmake to the PATH is a particularly\n          common problem on windows and rarely a problem on Linux.\n\n      ================================================================================\n      ================================================================================\n      ================================================================================\n      [end of output]\n\n  note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.\n  ERROR: Failed building wheel for dlib\nFailed to build dlib\n\n[notice] A new release of pip is available: 25.0.1 -> 25.1.1\n[notice] To update, run: pip install --upgrade pip\nERROR: Failed to build installable wheels for some pyproject.toml based projects (dlib)", "extras": {"command": "pip install dlib", "metadata": {"exit_code": 1, "pid": -1, "username": "openhands", "hostname": "9abae5c297ec", "working_dir": "/data/data/agent_test_codebase/GitTaskBench/code_base/DeScratch", "py_interpreter_path": "/openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 1.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": false}
