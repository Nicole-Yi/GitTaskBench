SETTING: You are an autonomous programmer, and you're working directly in the command line with a special interface.

The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.
In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use specific commands to help you navigate and edit files.
To call a command, you need to invoke it with a function call/tool call.

Please note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.

For example, if you are looking at this file:

def fct():
    print("Hello world")

and you want to edit the file to read:

def fct():
    print("Hello")
    print("world")

you search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `"Hello"\n    print("world")`
(note the extra spaces before the print statement!).

You could also get the same result by search for `    print("Hello world")` and replace with `    print("Hello")\n    print("world")`.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your shell prompt is formatted as follows:
(Open file: <path>)
(Current directory: <cwd>)
bash-$

First, you should _always_ include a general thought about what you're going to do next.
Then, for every response, you must include exactly _ONE_ tool call/function call.

Remember, you should always include a _SINGLE_ tool call/function call and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first tool call, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second .
Note that the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:
ISSUE:

## 任务描述
从给定的仓库列表中选取合适的仓库，使用Artistic模式，实现给一张黑黄白的老街巷照片，给其上色，使其变为色彩丰富的照片

## 可用仓库
仓库名称: DeOldify
仓库路径 (绝对): /data/data/agent_test_codebase/GitTaskBench/code_base/DeOldify
理解指南: ['阅读README.md了解项目基本功能和使用方法']

## 文件路径
输入：
文件路径 (绝对): /data/data/agent_test_codebase/GitTaskBench/queries/DeOldify_02/input/DeOldify_02_input.webp
文件描述: 需要上色的黑白图片

输出：
输出文件目录:/data/data/agent_test_codebase/GitTaskBench/eval_automation/output/DeOldify_02, 如果只有一个文件，就以 `output` 命名; 如果存在多个以 `output_01`开始命名，格式根据需求指定。

## 补充说明
**核心目标**: 快速理解和分析代码仓库，生成并执行必要的代码或调用工具，以高效、准确地完成用户指定的任务。

## 工作流程与规范

1.  **理解任务**: 仔细分析用户提供的任务描述 (`<task>`)、工作目录 (`<work_dir>`)、仓库信息 (`<repo>`) 和代码重要性提示 (`<code_importance>`)。
2.  **规划方案**: 
    *   如果没有现成计划，先制定清晰的执行步骤。请先阅读代码库的README.md文件，了解代码库的结构和使用方法。
    *   如果没有README.md文件或者README.md文件中没有提供足够信息，请先阅读代码库的代码，了解代码库的结构和使用方法。
    *   明确哪些步骤需要编写代码，哪些步骤依赖语言理解和工具调用。
    *   代码生成和执行过程中，涉及到路径的请使用绝对路径，不要使用相对路径，以免出现路径错误。
3.  **代码库分析**: 
    *   **探索结构**: 快速了解仓库的整体文件和目录结构, 请使用绝对路径。
    *   **识别关键文件**: 优先关注 `README.md`, 配置文件, 主入口脚本等。
    *   **依赖管理**: 
        *   检查 `requirements.txt` 或类似文件，确定所需依赖。
        *   **如果需要安装依赖**：在代码块中包含安装命令 (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt` 或 `pip install specific_package`)。检查包是否存在避免重复安装。
        *   **不要使用conda install，请使用pip install**。
        *   **环境配置**: Python/Conda环境已预设，无需额外配置。但需确保代码库路径在`PYTHONPATH`中，**必要时生成** `export PYTHONPATH=\"$PYTHONPATH:{remote_repo_path}\"` 命令。
4. 代码实现和执行
    * 提供详细的代码及实现步骤，包含完整的函数/类定义、参数和返回值,提供必要的注释和文档字符串
    * 如果需要依赖一些checkpoint模型文件，请先检查是否存在，如果存在，则直接使用，否则先下载checkpoint文件，再使用(需要自动下载)
        * 比如需要下载checkpoint文件，请使用`wget`命令下载，如果需要下载多个文件，请使用`wget -O`命令下载。

5.  **错误处理与迭代**: 
    *   检查代码执行结果。
    *   如果出现错误，分析原因，**修复代码**并重新生成**完整**脚本进行尝试。
    *   如果多次尝试后仍无法解决或任务无法完成，分析原因并考虑替代方案。
6.  **工具优先**: 
    *   **如果需要依赖一些checkpoint模型文件，请先检查是否存在，如果存在，则直接使用，否则先下载checkpoint文件，再使用(需要自动下载)
7.  **任务完成**: 
    *   当任务成功完成，或确认无法完成时，提供清晰的总结。

## !! 关键约束与强制要求 !!

*   **绝对路径**: 在代码中处理文件（特别是数据加载）时，**必须**使用**绝对路径**。
*   **提供的仓库 > 代码**: 现有仓库代码能完成的任务，**严禁**自行重新编写代码实现。
*   **请先阅读代码库的README.md文件，了解代码库的结构和使用方法**。如果没有README.md文件或者README.md文件中没有提供足够信息，请先阅读代码库的代码，了解代码库的结构和使用方法。

** 执行前首先运行 `eval $(curl -s http://deploy.i.shaipower.com/httpproxy)`

INSTRUCTIONS:
Now, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.
Remember, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE EXACTLY ONE TOOL CALL/FUNCTION CALL PER RESPONSE.
When you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.
Note however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with the python command.

NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!

GENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:

1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!

2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.

3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file "buggy-input.png" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.

4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current open file.

5. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.

6. When editing files, first explain the code you want to edit and why it is causing the problem. Then explain the edit you want to make and how it fixes the problem. Explain how the edit does not break existing functionality.

7. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This will usually not work. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed.

STRATEGY:

1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.
  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.
  Then start trying to fix it.

  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print("Script completed successfully, no errors.") command at the end of the file,
  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.

2. Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit.

3. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.

4. When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.

5. Create additional tests to verify the fix in a style similar to the existing reproduction script. In particular, make sure to test edge cases.
   If you find any issues, go back to the file you edited and perform further edits.

The file listing shows that there are several Jupyter notebooks related to colorizing images and videos, namely `ImageColorizerColab.ipynb`, `VideoColorizerColab.ipynb`, and other training notebooks. We also have pretrained weights such as `ColorizeArtistic_gen.pth` in the `models` directory which seems to be what we need for the Artistic model. 

The next step is to focus on the most relevant notebook for our task, `ImageColorizerColab.ipynb`, which is meant for image artistic colorization. Let's take a look at this notebook to understand the steps required to run our task.
