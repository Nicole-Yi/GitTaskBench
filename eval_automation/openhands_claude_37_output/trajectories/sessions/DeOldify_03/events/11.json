We have that archived here:  <https://github.com/dana-kelley/DeOldify>\n484-\n485-## Want More?\n486-\n487-Follow [#DeOldify](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Deoldify) on Twitter.\n488-\n489-## License\n490-\n491-All code in this repository is under the MIT license as specified by the LICENSE\n492-file.\n493-\n494:The model weights listed in this readme under the \"Pretrained Weights\" section\n495-are trained by ourselves and are released under the MIT license.\n496-\n497-## A Statement on Open Source Support\n498-\n499-We believe that open source has done a lot of good for the world.\u00a0 After all,\n500-DeOldify simply wouldn't exist without it. But we also believe that there needs\n501-to be boundaries on just how much is reasonable to be expected from an open\n502-source project maintained by just two developers.\n503-\n504-Our stance is that we're providing the code and documentation on research that\n505-we believe is beneficial to the world.\u00a0 What we have provided are novel takes\n506-on colorization, GANs, and video that are hopefully somewhat friendly for\n507-developers and researchers to learn from and adopt. This is the culmination of\n508-well over a year of continuous work, free for you. What wasn't free was\n509-shouldered by us, the developers.\u00a0 We left our jobs, bought expensive GPUs, and\n510-had huge electric bills as a result of dedicating ourselves to this.\n511-\n512-What we haven't provided here is a ready to use free \"product\" or \"app\", and we\n513-don't ever intend on providing that.\u00a0 It's going to remain a Linux based project\n514-without Windows support, coded in Python, and requiring people to have some extra\n515-technical background to be comfortable using it.\u00a0 Others have stepped in with\n516-their own apps made with DeOldify, some paid and some free, which is what we want!\n517-We're instead focusing on what we believe we can do best- making better\n518-commercial models that people will pay for.\n519-Does that mean you're not getting the very best for free?\u00a0 Of course. We simply\n520-don't believe that we're obligated to provide that, nor is it feasible! We\n521-compete on research and sell that.\u00a0 Not a GUI or web service that wraps said\n522-research- that part isn't something we're going to be great at anyways. We're not\n523-about to shoot ourselves in the foot by giving away our actual competitive\n524-advantage for free, quite frankly.\n525-\n526-We're also not willing to go down the rabbit hole of providing endless, open\n527-ended and personalized support on this open source project.\u00a0 Our position is\n528-this:\u00a0 If you have the proper background and resources, the project provides\n529-more than enough to get you started. We know this because we've seen plenty of\n530-people using it and making money off of their own projects with it.\n531-\n532-Thus, if you have an issue come up and it happens to be an actual bug that\n533-having it be fixed will benefit users generally, then great- that's something\n534-we'll be happy to look into.\n535-\n536-In contrast, if you're asking about something that really amounts to asking for\n537-personalized and time consuming support that won't benefit anybody else, we're\n538-not going to help. It's simply not in our interest to do that. We have bills to\n539-pay, after all. And if you're asking for help on something that can already be\n540-derived from the documentation or code?\u00a0 That's simply annoying, and we're not\n541-going to pretend to be ok with that.", "extras": {"command": "grep -n \"Pretrained Weights\" -A 50 /data/data/agent_test_codebase/GitTaskBench/code_base/DeOldify/README.md", "metadata": {"exit_code": 0, "pid": -1, "username": "openhands", "hostname": "2850ec31e6cd", "working_dir": "/data/data/agent_test_codebase/GitTaskBench", "py_interpreter_path": "/openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python", "prefix": "", "suffix": "\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]"}, "hidden": false}, "success": true}
