To proceed efficiently, we'll need to fulfill the following steps based on the insights from the README.md:\n\n1. **Installation**:\n   - Ensure Python and PyTorch versions match the requirements specified (`python>=3.8`, `torch>=1.13`).\n   - Install the FunASR package and necessary dependencies, including `modelscope` and `huggingface_hub`.\n\n2. **Model Handling**:\n   - Verify if the necessary model files are available locally for ASR and punctuation restoration. If not, download them using wget or through platforms linked in the README.md.\n\n3. **Script Execution**:\n   - Implement or execute a script leveraging the FunASR toolkit to process the provided audio file `/data/data/agent_test_codebase/GitTaskBench/queries/FunASR_03/input/FunASR_03_input.wav`.\n   - Ensure output is saved in the designated directory `/data/data/agent_test_codebase/GitTaskBench/eval_automation/output/FunASR_03` as per user instructions.\n\nI will start by installing the necessary dependencies and ensuring the environment is set up correctly.
