Typically, torchaudio requires an additional library like `soundfile` or `sox` to handle audio file decoding.\\n\\nTo resolve the issue:\\n1. Install `pydub` and `ffmpeg` to handle MP3 file conversion, as they are commonly recommended for working with MP3 files when torchaudio faces this challenge.\\n2. Convert the MP3 file to WAV format using `pydub`, which torchaudio can process easily.\\n3. Adjust the script to first convert the input MP3 file to WAV before diarization.\\n4. Reattempt diarization on the WAV file.\\n5.
