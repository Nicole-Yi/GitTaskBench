It includes an example spider script that extracts quotes from the `https://quotes.toscrape.com` website. This script can be utilized as a foundation for your task.\n\nHere's the plan to achieve the core goal:\n\n1. **Install Scrapy**: Since Scrapy might not be installed, we'll ensure it's installed in the environment using `pip install scrapy`.\n\n2. **Create Spider Script**: Use the suggestion from the README to create a spider script (`quotes_spider.py`) that scrapes quotes from the `humor` tag.\n\n3. **Run the Spider**: Run the spider script with output directed to a CSV file using Scrapy's command-line options.\n\n4. **Verify Output**: The output CSV file should reside in `/data/data/agent_test_codebase/GitTaskBench/eval_automation/output/Scrapy_02`.\n\nLet's proceed with implementing these steps.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments":
