Based on the README.md file and the repository structure, here are the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. **Dependencies Installation**: The necessary dependencies are listed under `requirements.txt`, and I've already initiated the installation process.\n\n2. **Dataset Preparation**:\n   - Clone the dataset repository from Hugging Face as described in the README.\n   - Update the `data_path` in `conf/dataset/PubLayNet.yaml` to the absolute path where the PubLayNet dataset folder is located.\n\n3. **Pre-trained Model Download**:\n   - Download the pre-trained models from the same Hugging Face repository to the `pretrained` directory.\n   \n4. **Training**:\n   - Use the `train.sh` script, adjusting the necessary hyperparameters as needed. This script facilitates training with options to modify parameters directly from the command line.\n\n5. **Testing**:\n   - Evaluate the model using the `src/test.py` script, providing relevant parameters like model, dataset, task, and checkpoint directory. Generated results will be stored in the `results` directory.\n\n6. **Output Management**:\n   - Ensure outputs, including trained models and result files, are placed in `/data/data/agent_test_codebase/GitTaskBench/eval_automation/output/LayoutFlow_01`.\n\nI'll proceed with executing the above steps, making necessary modifications in configuration files, and organizing outputs accordingly.", "action": "message", "llm_metrics": {"accumulated_cost": 0.1084225, "accumulated_token_usage": {"model": "gpt-4o", "prompt_tokens": 41333, "completion_tokens": 509, "cache_read_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "response_id": ""}, "costs": [], "response_latencies": [], "token_usages": []}, "args": {"content": "The goal is to generate a document layout using the LayoutFlow repository.
