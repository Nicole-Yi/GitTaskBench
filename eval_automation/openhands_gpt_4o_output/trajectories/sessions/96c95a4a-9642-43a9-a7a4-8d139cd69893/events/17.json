Also, no requirements.txt file exists in the repository, which indicates that dependencies may have to be managed manually or through the installation instructions provided in the README.\\n\\nApproach to resolve:\\n\\n1. **Install a more recent, compatible version of numpy** first as ISR might work with any version higher than numpy 1.16.2. For this, a more recent compatible numpy version with Python 3.12 can be searched and installed first.\\n\\n2. **Investigate if there's a version of ISR compatible without downgrading numpy**, This usually involves checking PyPI versions or documentation for compatibility information. However, the README suggested installing ISR directly via pip without specifying versions or additional dependencies, which might hint it's capable of running in recent set-ups.\\n\\n3. **Explicitly set numpy to a higher version and reinstall ISR**, using pip install commands with specific versions could resolve compatibility issues.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "call_N0uql89yAXrLgi2fxB7RsOSC", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 241, "prompt_tokens": 13069, "total_tokens": 13310, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
