I'll explore the `pyproject.toml` for installation instructions or dependencies that can be manually installed from local files. \\n\\nAlternatively, if no direct installation methods are available in the repository, we can attempt to perform the intended task (extracting metadata) by utilizing existing scripts from the `tests` directory or any top-level utilities that might serve the purpose, using the script directly to obtain metadata from the specified URL without requiring package installation. I should follow up by viewing the `pyproject.toml` and any relevant scripts for metadata extraction, given the current situation.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "call_QcoZvBMk2B0rQUb8ylFkJpcK", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 200, "prompt_tokens": 23673, "total_tokens": 23873, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
